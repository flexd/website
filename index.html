        <p>Hello Internet!</p>

        <p>My name is Kristoffer Berdal, and I'm too lazy to redo my website/blog at the moment, so this is all you get. Not that I ever wrote anything on the blog anyway, I was too busy procastinating.
        In my current day job I work in the Computer Security field. Most of my time elsewhere I spend as a developer of various things. I prefer <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> and Python, but I have used a lot of different languages through the years.</p>
        <p>If you want to email me, you can do so at web [AT SIGN] flexd.net. The fingerprint of my PGP key is <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x00771467DA233215">D9E5 4D8C 7CDB 6E83 06E6  EA72 0077 1467 DA23 3215</a> (verified in various ways on <a href="https://keybase.io/flexd">Keybase</a>).</p>
        <p>I am on <a href="https://github.com/flexd">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/flexd">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://no.linkedin.com/in/kristofferberdal">LinkedIn</a>. You can also find me on IRC as <strong>flexd</strong> on Freenode/EFnet/Coldfront.</p>
